I live in Silicon Valley, love the show Silicon Valley, but get easily tired of the superficiality and hype in Silicon Valley. My latest focus is to ask the question, **\"how can technology encourage us to become better people?\"**\r\n\r\nThis is my first AMA, and can't wait to see what is on everyone's minds! I'll answer this, as I'm sure it will be asked - yes, I actually do know seven versions of the running man.\r\n\r\n**I\u2019ll be answering your questions on starting at 10:00 AM PT**",
